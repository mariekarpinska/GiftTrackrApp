Project: Gift Giving Tracker
Meeting Time: lect04

Type of meeting: daily scrum

Team: Benjamin Yang [x], Marie Karpinska [x], Shang-Hsun Yang [x], Tanish Kumar [x], Archit Gupta []

People are preparing to setup their environments and do the first homework.

Next task: Do HW1.

No current roadblocks.

We talked about the types of users: 
1. Gift giver
2. Friends of those gift givers, co-worker etc.

Goals:
1. Never miss gift-giving occasion
2. Keep a budget
3. Always know what to give / what not to give 

How does the app help them meet these goals:
1. Calendar / reminders to tell them when to buy gifts
2. Notes within each birthday with links about suggestions for what to buy
3. Built-in budget tracking / dashboard
