Sandy has a bunch of friends whose birthdays are hard to remember. She keeps a big list of their likes/dislikes, but it's hard to remember so many birthdays and be reminded about what/when to give. She hears about an app that makes this much easier. She can input her friends' birthdays into the app, as well as their likes/dislikes. The app will then automatically remind her when to start looking for gifts for a friend's birthday, ensuring timely delivery and no hurt feelings. The app will also be able to suggest different types of products on the market within a pre-determined budget to make shopping easier for her. This app allows her to eliminate the constant stress of remembering birthdays and having to constantly generate new ideas about what to give.
