### Each Person's Commentary on Their Contribution

#### Marie Karpinska

During my time contributing to the GiftTrackr App, I've been actively involved with 71 commits, adding 2,537 lines of code and refining the project with 721 deletions. The overall numbers from Github's insights are incorrect because they include 29,117++ and 30,150-- from initializing the app. I've made 11 pull requests and reviewed 10, emphasizing collaboration and continuous improvement. The large amount of commits is likely from me committing work to branches several times before completion, allowing for experimentation and easy navigation between different app versions, particularly useful for code reviews. My React background played a key role in transitioning to React Native and being able to contribute significantly to this project. I'm content with my contributions and recognize the diverse strengths each teammate brings to the project!

#### Tanish Kumar

Throughout the quarter, I have been a very involved and helpful team member on the GiftTrackr app. I have made 8 pull requests and reviewed 7. I have been timely in both submitting PRs as well as reviewing them. The things I worked on in the app were multiple versions of the Calendar screen, adding the initial show/hide password functionality, and then OpenAI API integration for the Gift Suggestions feature. One thing to improve on in the future is committing my code more often, as I would often wait until features were done to commit my code. Overall, I am happy with my contributions and had a very fun time working on the GiftTrackr app!

#### Archit Gupta

During my time contributing to the GiftTrackr App, I've poured my dedication into 11 impactful commits that enriched the app with 942 additions while cleaning up with 401 deletions. My focus was on the complete development of the Budget and GiftHistory pages, two out of our respective five app pages, and the most functionality-heavy aspects of our screens. Both pages are now foundational features that now stand robust and user-oriented. I steered 4 pull requests to fruition and took part in reviewing another, ensuring that our collaborative efforts resonated with quality and cohesiveness. My foray into React Native, bolstered by a solid React background, was a pivotal force in sculpting these features. My commitment was to deliver not just code, but value, learning, and adaptability, recognizing that the strength of our project lies in the mosaic of our diverse contributions.

#### Shang-Hsun Yang
Within the development process of the GiftTrackr application, my primary responsibility is to implement the "add gift" page, ensure data synchronization with the Firebase service, and conduct evaluations of our application. In the team, I function as a software test engineer or product quality assurance engineer, aiming to enhance the perfection of our application and diligently identifying any issues and bugs. With numerous pull requests from team members, obsolete elements are discarded, and new features are incorporated. My role includes ensuring that users experience the best release version of the application with no visible errors. One area for improvement within our team is optimizing various meetings and accelerating development under the SCRUM method. Lastly, I have a deep appreciation for this team and the project!

#### Benjamin Yang
Throughout my time working on the GiftTrackr app I've helped to make 35 commits spanning across login/logout functionality and storing data in firebase. The numbers from github are inaccurate due to some accidental commits on the package.json files but I added around 1000 lines of code. I also helped to review a good amount of pull requests and get our project running. I would say my main contribution was allowing our application to effectively communicate with Firebase and design the initial overall schema, also allowing robust log-in/log-out ability. I was very happy with the contributions that my teammates made and thought that we worked together effectively as a team. Throughout the quarter, I was very diligent wuth completing my tasks on time and made sure the features that I committed were robust and error-free.
