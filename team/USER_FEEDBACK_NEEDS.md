Three things about our product that you would love to have user feedback on:
1. User satisfaction with how to navigate the Add gift page. Lots of people submitted that the UI could improve for that from our MVP.
2. User satisfcation with data privacy. For users who care about the privacy of their personal information --- can they delete their accounts? How do we use their personal data/info.
3. User satisfication with different kinds of screens/devices.
