Hi, I'm Marie. I'm in my last year as an undergraduate at UCSB studying Computer Science and Psychological & Brain Sciences. I am big on chasing my curiosity by answering questions with data; from answering questions in the field of spatial neuroscience to how much time my morning routine takes and how that changes over time; I love it all. I have experience in mobile app development building a web browser application for the Excursion club so that staff members can manage members, gear, and the staff roster. Outside of coding, I love climbing, painting, and backpacking.
