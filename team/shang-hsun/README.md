Evaluation Report

Log-in Page: Functionality is good. In sign-up mode, the title overlaps with the top area of a phone. Password strength should be checked during account creation.

Upcoming Gifts Page: Functionality is good. The location of the receipt name and date is too close. When the budget is a large amount, it may extend beyond the block. Multiple gifts for the same week display only one.

Calendar Page: Functionality is good. The gift event is too small. Navigation for changing the month and year is not user-friendly.

Budget Page: Functionality is good. Users should be prohibited from entering more than three digits after the decimal point. Avoid displaying "$NaN" error messages.

Add Gift Page: Functionality is good, but when there's a typo in the date field, the automatically generated slash cannot be deleted, preventing the user from inputting the correct date.

Past Gift Page: Functionality is good. The first gift data's location is too high. The style of the history gifts page should match that of the upcoming gifts page. A delete button is needed, and the gift data should be sorted by date.

Notification Page: Functionality is good, but after the input block, it misses the word "day(s)."

Miscellaneous Issues: Users cannot log out. When adding a today's gift data on the past gift page, this data also shows on the upcoming gift page.
