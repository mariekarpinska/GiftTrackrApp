# Gift Giving Tracker (pj-react-03)
An app to keep track of what your friends like, when you plan on giving them gifts, store links for purchasing, and keep track of your budget.

# Tech stack:

React-Native, (NativeBase component Library)
The tech stack for our Gift Giving App is built on a robust and efficient foundation. We’ve leveraged React Native, a popular and versatile framework for cross-platform mobile development, to ensure that our app runs seamlessly on both iOS and Android devices. Expo CLI further simplifies the development process by providing a suite of tools for rapid iteration and quick deployment. To enhance the user interface and streamline the development process, we’re integrating the NativeBase component library, which offers a rich set of pre-designed UI components. With this tech stack, we’ve achieved a perfect blend of performance, flexibility, and a polished user experience.

# User Roles:

# Installation
## Prerequisites
Before following the installation instructions, make sure you have the following installed:

### Expo CLI and React Native:

If you don't already have Node.js installed, download and install it from nodejs.org.
Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install Expo CLI globally:
`npm install -g expo-cli`
To install React Native, use the following command:
`npm install -g react-native-cli`

### Expo Go App on Your Phone:

On your Android or iOS device, go to your respective app store (Google Play Store for Android or the Apple App Store for iOS).
Search for "Expo Go" and install the Expo Go app on your device.
Please ensure that you have Expo CLI, React Native, and the Expo Go app installed before following the specific installation instructions for your mobile app project. The ultimate goal is to deploy your app with a single button press, and in the near future, we'll work on automating the generation of binary distributions (APK for Android or IPA for iOS) from your codebase.
