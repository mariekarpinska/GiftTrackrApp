Present: Marie Karpinska, Shang-Hsun Yang, Archit Gupta, Tanish Kumar, Ben Yang (2/5 members virtual)

## Overarching Goal: 
Our overarching goal is to improve our app development process by iterating on MVP feedback, implementing changes, and ensuring that every acceptance criteria in the issues we complete is met. We aim to do this while maintaining a quick turnaround for tasks and adding new features to the app.

## Change: 
We will enhance our communication and review process. This includes more communication when running into trouble on tasks, reviewing PRâ€™s faster, and testing every acceptance criteria item before making a pull request. We will also assign a reviewer when creating a new PR and set decided upon partner reviewers at the beginning of each week.

## Measurement: 
We will measure our progress by the amount of comments or revisions on PR to show if someone needs help, the average time from PR creation to reviewing+merging, and by posting a screenshot of the feature working on your local when you approve a pull request.

## Other Notes:
Lastly, we want to acknowledge the great job everyone has done. All 5 of us came together with no app building experience and made this awesome functional gift tracker. Almost all of the pages of our MVP were working with nothing hardcoded, which is especially impressive given how much of that was not present in the other MVPs. Great job, team!

## Outcome:
In our retrospective meeting, we discussed and agreed upon key changes to enhance our app development process. Our overarching goal remains focused on continuous improvement and meeting acceptance criteria for issues. To achieve this, we've identified the need for improved communication and review processes. Team members will communicate more effectively when facing challenges, accelerate the review of pull requests, and ensure thorough testing of acceptance criteria before making a pull request. Additionally, we've implemented measures such as assigning a reviewer upon PR creation. To gauge our progress, we'll be tracking the number of revisions on PRs, monitoring the average time from PR creation to review, and encouraging the posting of screenshots demonstrating the feature's functionality when approving a pull request. These changes aim to foster a more efficient and collaborative development environment.
