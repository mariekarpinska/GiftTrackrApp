Present: Marie Karpinska, Shang-Hsun Yang, Archit Gupta, Tanish Kumar, Ben Yang (2/5 members virtual)

## Overarching Goal: 
Our overarching goal is to improve our app development process by iterating on MVP feedback, implementing changes, and ensuring that every acceptance criteria in the issues we complete is met. We aim to do this while maintaining a quick turnaround for tasks and adding new features to the app.

## Change: 
We will enhance our communication and review process. This includes more communication when running into trouble on tasks, reviewing PRâ€™s faster, and testing every acceptance criteria item before making a pull request. We will also assign a reviewer when creating a new PR and set decided upon partner reviewers at the beginning of each week.

## Measurement: 
We will measure our progress by the amount of comments or revisions on PR to show if someone needs help, the average time from PR creation to reviewing+merging, and by posting a screenshot of the feature working on your local when you approve a pull request.

## Other Notes:
Lastly, we want to acknowledge the great job everyone has done. All 5 of us came together with no app building experience and made this awesome functional gift tracker. Almost all of the pages of our MVP were working with nothing hardcoded, which is especially impressive given how much of that was not present in the other MVPs. Great job, team!

## Outcome:
In our retrospective meeting, we discussed and agreed upon key changes to enhance our app development process, with a continued focus on continuous improvement and meeting acceptance criteria for issues. The identified improvements include more effective communication during challenges, accelerated reviews of pull requests, and rigorous testing of acceptance criteria before submission. Measures such as assigning a reviewer upon PR creation have streamlined our processes. To gauge progress, we now track the number of revisions on PRs, monitor the average time from creation to review, and encourage the posting of screenshots demonstrating feature functionality during PR approval. Following the implementation of these changes, the retrospective revealed positive outcomes, fostering a more efficient and collaborative development environment that aligns with our goal of continuous improvement and meeting acceptance criteria with greater precision.
